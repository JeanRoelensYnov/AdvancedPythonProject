## I'm stuck

Those below are answer's for the two riddle of our game so don't read further if you don't want to spoil your fun.


Answer for riddle 1 : David

Answer for encrypted riddle : Queue 

The second riddle is encrypted by vigener encryption using the server name as the key.

Once you decrypt the vigener code you got : What word is pronounced the same if you take away four of its five letters ?"

For the tic-tac-toe game we don't have any answer just try hard and beat the machine, sorry.
